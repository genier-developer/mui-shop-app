# MUI Shop App

## Overview

The **MUI Shop App** is a simple e-commerce application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Material-UI** components from the MUI library. The app allows users to browse through a list of products, add items to their shopping cart, and get notifications when an item is added. It is a small demonstration of using Material-UI for layout and styling along with a shopping cart functionality.

## Features

- Display a list of goods with product information such as name, price, and category.
- Add products to the shopping cart.
- View the shopping cart and total cost of items.
- Search functionality to filter products.
- Snackbar notification when a product is added to the cart.
- Built with modern tools like React, TypeScript, Vite, and MUI.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A popular React UI framework with pre-built components based on Google's Material Design.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling for fast development.
